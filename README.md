# AutomataExs
A repository where I upload my automata examples.

This reposiory is where I upload my automata problems and soloutions.
You can find original problems from the textbook: Introduction to Automata Theory Languages and Computation 3rd edition 
I would upload my python codes to check whether my soloution (DFA, NFA) is correct. 

Please be aware that I might be wrong with the soloutions since I am just in a learning state.
If there are any questions, please contact me via edina00@naver.com
